== API

Generally, the library consists of two parts:

* Translating a batch of elements using an implementation of link:src/main/groovy/com/hpe/amce/translation/BatchTranslator.groovy[BatchTranslator]. The idea is to use decorator pattern to finely control how batch is handled including tracing, metrics, "best effort", error logging, etc. See usage example in 
link:src/test/groovy/com/hpe/amce/translation/impl/OnParWithLegacyTest.groovy#L115[unit test].
* Mapping fields of an input object to an output object using link:src/main/groovy/com/hpe/amce/mapping/ObjectMapper.groovy[ObjectMapper]. Here, idea is to define mapping as a table where each row defines input or out field and columns specify default value, value validation, value translation, etc. You can see a glimpse of example in the following link:src/test/groovy/com/hpe/amce/mapping/MapperTest.groovy#L468[unit test].

Of course, it is natural to use `BatchTranslator` for a batch handling while applying `ObjectMapper` to individual elements of that batch. However, one works just fine without another too.

== Background ==

The standard algorithmic approach to data translation and conversion
involves looping over received records and then constructing
records in target system data format using logical branches that
test for the presence of fields or specific values of fields in input
data record to determine if output filed should be added and what
should be the value of this field.

The standard approach presents the following problems:

* Missing input field or a mismatch between expected and actual
format of input field often results in a processing error that
causes loss of the whole batch of records.
* Complexity of translation procedure is a product of a number of
input and output fields. When number of either input or output fields
is substantial, this complexity and a lack of modularity make it
extremely difficult to implement the translation and even more
difficult to prove correctness of this implementation.
* When input records that match a certain condition have to be
omitted from result (filtered out) or a single input record
matching a specific condition should result in multiple
output records then the standard algorithmic approach often results
in extremely complex implementation that is very hard to maintain
due to its complexity.

== Summary ==

In accordance with phased table-based batch data translation,
input data processing is represented as a number of phases.
Each phase has an input consisting of zero or more input records.
A result of processing an input at a particular phase determines
output of this phase. The phases are ordered and chained together.
The first phase receives data from the source system as an input.
The second phase receives output of the first phase as an input.
The third phase receives output of the second phase as an input and so
on. An output of the last phase is sent to the target telecommunications
system.

Each phase iterates over input records to perform per-record processing.
The output of each of these iterations for a particular record
is a set of output records. Each input record could result in
zero, one or many output records. All output records from all
iterations are aggregated into output of this particular phase.

The phases generally have three types:

. Filters conditionally remove input records
. Transformers conditionally transform input record into output record
. Injectors conditionally add additional output records

A transformer is defined by one or more ordered tables that contain definition of
how to process input record and construct output record.
Each record in translation table has the following columns:

. Indication of optionality
. Input data extraction
. Default value
. Data validation
. Data translation
. Output data injection

Each column is defined in terms of input and output record.
When an input record is translated, processing defined by each
table row is applied to it in order defined by order of rows in a table.
A result of application of all translation table rows to an input record
becomes an output record.

Between each iteration over input records each phase checks for any errors
that have occurred. If processing of an input record has resulted in an error
then this error is recorded in operational journal
and processing continues on the same phase but for the next
input record.

== Detailed description ==

Phased table-based batch data translation presents a combination of data packet splitting into records,
splitting processing into phases, per-record processing resulting in
varying number of output records, table based translation definition
and final records aggregation.

.Combining phased processing, per-record processing and output record aggregation
image:Combining-phased-processing.svg[]

An input data packet received from source telecommunications system and output data
packet that should be sent to target telecommunications system are split
into individual records (for example, events, faults, alarms, incidents and so on).
Input and output data packets could consist of zero, one or many records.

.Splitting data into records
image:Splitting-data-into-records.svg[]

Processing of input data to prepare output data is split into phases. The phases are
chained together so the output of a previous phase becomes an input of the next
phase.

.Ordered chaining of phases
image:Ordered-chaining-of-phases.svg[]

A phase could produce as its output a set with a different number of records compared to its
input. Depending on a number of records in output set, a phase could implement one
of the three functions:

. Filter - output has fewer records than input;
. Transformer - output has the same number of records as input;
. Injector - output has more records than input.

Each type of phase iterates over input set of records in their respective order. For each input record,
a phase generates zero, one or many output records based on a criteria.

This criteria is defined for each phase. The definition of the criteria uses one or more
of the following:

. Tests characteristics of individual input record;
. Evaluates condition based on aggregated characteristic prepared by one of the previous phases;
. Evaluates condition based on general environment characteristics;
. Aggregated characteristics calculated by a previous stage;
. Output field value calculated by a previous mapping table row.

Result of processing each input record
is added to the end of phase's output. Combined set of output records returned as phase's result.

.Per-record processing inside a phase
image:Per-record-processing-inside-a-phase.svg[]

A filter is used to remove from input certain records based on a defined criteria.
On each iteration a filter returns either empty set or a set consisting of single element - original
input record.

A transformer is used to convert between input and output data formats and
optionally to calculate aggregated characteristics that can be used
by later stages. On each iteration a transformer returns a set consisting of single element.
Based on a defined criteria, this could be original input record or a new record that is
result of translating input record.

An injector is used to add additional output records based on a defined criteria.
On each iteration an injector returns either a set consisting of original input record
or a set that contains original input record and one or more additional records.
Those additional records differ from input record and can be either of the following:

. Modified original input record flagged to be translated by later stages in a way
different compared to original input record;
. Final resulting record in a format of a target telecommunications system and not
requiring further modifications. In this case, injector uses the same table based approach
to translate input record into output record.

.Types of phases
image:Types-of-phases.svg[]

For the means of criteria evaluation on a per-input record basis
and for the means of constructing new translated records from
input records, both input records and output records
are assumed to be consisting of fields.
The fields of input records and output records are not required to match
and are not required to form a flat structure where every field has
a scalar value and is placed on the same level as other fields.
On a contrary, the proposed approach embraces diversity in a number, types and
structure of input and output fields.

The value of a field can be any of the following:

. Scalar value
. List of scalar values
. A structure consisting of other fields or lists of fields
. A list of structures consisting of other fields or lists of fields

.Variations of fields complexity
image:Variations-of-fields-complexity.svg[]

Transformer uses table based definition of how input record should
be mapped to output record. Definition of this mapping table has the following columns:

. Indication of optionality
. Input data extraction (further referred as getter)
. Default value (further referred as defaulter)
. Data validation (further referred as validator)
. Data translation (further referred as translator)
. Output data injection (further referred as setter)

A transformer can use one or many mapping tables. A defined criteria
is used to determine if for a particular input record a mapping table should be used
to produce new translated output record or original input record should be used
unaltered as output record and (if multiple mapping tables are defined) which
of the defined mapping tables should be used. A mapping table can have one or many rows.

.Relationship between transformer and mapping table
image:Relationship-between-transformer-and-mapping-table.svg[]

To create a new translated record from an input record, transformer
iterates over all rows in selected mapping table in the order these rows
are defined. For each row, transformer performs a series of steps defined
by columns values for this row.

.Using rows of mapping table in transformer
image:Using-rows-of-mapping-table-in-transformer.svg[]

Getter extracts field value (which could be a structure or list
of structures) from an input record and returns it.

Defaulter returns a value to be used as output field value in any of the following cases:

. Input record does not have an input field referred to by the current mapping table row;
. An input field, referred by the current mapping table row, does not have a value in
input record;
. A value of input field extracted from input record does not conform to the defined requirements
as specified in data validation column of the mapping table row;
. An error happens during input field value extraction, validation or translation.

Validator checks if field value extracted from an input record
matches defined requirements for the field:

. Format;
. Range;
. Inclusion or exclusion from a defined set of allowed or disallowed values.

Translator calculates output field value using any or all of the following:

. Input field value;
. Configuration parameters;
. Operational environment characteristics;
. Aggregated characteristics calculated by earlier phases.

Setter injects output field value into a partial output record on which phase currently operates on.

.Mapping table row
image:Mapping-table-row.svg[]

The actual behavior for a particular row depends on the actual combination
of column values. Column values are optional (except for indication of optionality).

In the simplest case, transformer performs the following steps:

. Extracts a field from input record by calling getter
. Validates field value by calling validator
. Translates field value by calling translator
. Injects field into output record by calling setter

.Simple case of mapping table row processing
image:Simple-case-of-mapping-table-row-processing.svg[]

Further, transformer is enhanced to account for an input field value being absent,
error happening in getter, translator or setter. In addition to a normal case
when every row of mapping table is applied to an input record and resulting new
translated record is returned from transformer, two additional outcomes are added:

. code error - indicates problem with mapping table definition;
. data error - indicates problem with input data.

.Data error and code error detection in transformer
image:Data-error-and-code-error.svg[]

When either code error or data error is detected:

. transformer stops iterating over rows of a mapping table;
. an error is recorded in operational journal;
. resulting record is not added to the set of output records,
instead phase continues processing with the next input record.

If a defaulter is defined for a particular row of a mapping table
then this defaulter is used when
there is a problem with input data as detected for data error.
When defaulter is called then the value it returns is used instead of
translating input field value. If defaulter evaluates successfully then
processing of mapping table row and input record is not interrupted
and continues further.

Whenever a defaulter is used upon data error, a warning message is
recorded in operational journal
with detailed problem description.

.Usage of defaulter in transformer
image:Usage-of-defaulter-in-transformer.svg[]

A single or multiple but not all columns in a mapping table for a particular
row could be empty. Processing of input record differs based on
which columns are defined for a particular row in a mapping table.
This allows implementation of different functions using the same form of
translation definition and the same implementation of base
algorithm that applies processing defined by a mapping table row
to an input record.

If translator is not defined for a particular row in a mapping table
then it is assumed that
input value should be propagated to output unaltered
(could also be optionally checked by validator before pushing to output).

.Propagating field value from input record to output record unaltered
image:Propagating-field-value.svg[]

Getter not defined for a particular row of a mapping table
can be used to set output field to a pre-defined value.
In this mode neither validator nor translator have a chance to be used
so it is a code error to try to specify them.

.Setting a field in output record to a pre-defined value
image:Setting-a-field-in-output.svg[]

Setter undefined for a particular row of a mapping table
could be used to
verify input data: if input field is absent or has invalid
value then either error or warning operational journal record is generated
based on field optionality flag.
Since nothing is propagated to output record, it is useless and so
invalid to set defaulter or translator in this mode (code error).

.Validating input data
image:Validating-input-data.svg[]

Based on field optionality flag, transformer reacts differently when
a value for a field is absent in an input record:

. For optional field,
do not consider this as a problem with input data but try to use defaulter,
skip mapping table row if defaulter is not defined;
. For mandatory field,
consider this as a problem with input data,
record a warning message in operational journal if defaulter is defined
or throw data error if it is not defined.

Based on field optionality flag, transformer reacts differently when
defaulter is not defined for a particular mapping table row
and a data error is detected for input record:

. For optional field,
record a warning message in operational journal, skip further processing
of the current mapping table row and continue with the next one;
. For mandatory field,
consider this to be a data error, record the reason in operational journal
and continue processing with the next input record.

Based on field optionality flag, transformer reacts differently when
defaulter returns an undefined value:

. For optional field,
do not consider this situation to be an error,
continue processing with the next mapping table row;
. For mandatory field,
consider this situation to be a code error related to
definition of a mapping table (undefined value is
not an appropriate default value for a mandatory field).

Based on field optionality flag, transformer reacts differently when
translator returns an undefined value:

. For optional field,
do not consider this situation to be an error,
continue processing with the next mapping table row;
. For mandatory field,
consider this situation to be a code error related to
definition of a mapping table (undefined value is
not an appropriate translated value for a mandatory field).

Between each iteration over input records each phase checks for any errors
that have occurred. If processing of an input record has resulted in an error
then this error is recorded in operational journal
and processing continues on the same phase but for the next
input record.

To process an input record according to a mapping table row,
transformer advances from one column to the next in a particular row.
To determine to which column to perform transition and to perform the work
defined by a column value, transformer defines two state machines:

. For mandatory fields;
. For optional fields.

The current condition of a state machine is stored in a context.
The context is created when an input record is beginning
to be processed according to a particular row in a mapping table.
Once this processing is finished, the context is not longer needed
and is either disposed or reused for the next row by rewriting the
data it has previously contained. The context holds the following:

. Input record;
. Partial output record;
. Current field value;
. Current encountered error;
. Additional global parameters.

State machines for mandatory and optional fields
are defined in terms of the following states:

. Getter
. Defaulter
. Validator
. Translator
. Setter
. End
. Warning
. Warning if defined or data error if undefined
. Code error

Each type of state has an action associated with it. This action
is executed when state machine enters the state.
The action receives the context as an input and can alter this context.

Each state has four options that differ for optional and for
mandatory fields. These options define into which next state the
state machine should transition based on current conditions after
the action is executed.
These options are the following:

. Transition in case of an error (further referred to as onError);
. Transition in case of current state being evaluated to
undefined value (further referred to as onNull);
. Transition in case current state evaluates to a defined value
(further referred to as onNonNull);
. Transition in case current state is undefined for
a current row in a mapping table
(further referred to as onUndefined).

.State of a state machine used to process input record according to row of a mapping table
image:State-of-a-state-machine.svg[]

.State transitions to other states based on current conditions
image:State-transitions.svg[]

Getter reads input field value as defined by the row in a mapping table
using input record in the context and writes this value into
current field value of the context. After this getter transitions
to the next state based on current conditions.

Defaulter calculates value as defined by the row in a mapping table
as writes this value into current field value of the context.
After this defaulter transitions
to the next state based on current conditions.

Validator reads current field value of the context, checks this
value as defined by the row in a mapping table but does not
alter the context.
After this validator transitions
to the next state based on current conditions.

Translator reads current field value of the context, calculates
new value as defined by the row of a mapping table and writes this
value back into current field value of the context.
After this translator transitions
to the next state based on current conditions.

Setter reads current field value of the context and
writes this value to partial output record of the context
as defined by the row of a mapping table.
After this setter transitions
to the next state based on current conditions.

End reads partial output record of the context and returns
it as result for the current row of a mapping table without
transitioning to other states.

Warning state records a warning message in operational
journal and delegates to whatever other state it wraps.

State "Warning if defined or data error if undefined"
checks if current column value is defined for the row in a mapping table.
If it is defined then a warning message is recorded in
operational journal and further processing is delegated to
the other state it wraps. If the column value is not
defined then error is raised and further processing
of this mapping table row is interrupted.

State "Code error" interrupts further processing of
a mapping table row for the current input record and
raises error.

The following is a definition of state machine for the mandatory fields:

.State machine for mandatory fields
image:State-machine-for-mandatory-fields.svg[]

The following is a definition of state machine for the optional fields:

.State machine for optional fields
image:State-machine-for-optional-fields.svg[]

== Usage ==

Generally code should match columns in FS. Each row in FS
represents a single Field object used by a Mapper.
The Field object carries these 6 settings that Mapper reads
to execute a single FS row.
To have full FS table covered multiple Field objects are to
be injected into Mapper. Generally, what's written in FS
translation table is directly translated into Mapper
configuration table.

Each Field object is configured with closures and can be represented
as the following:

image:Field.svg[]

The actual types are generic class type parameters that you
specify in configuration:

* OriginalObjectType is OO
* ResultObjectType is RO
* OriginalFieldType is OF
* ResultFieldType is RF

If you have specified correct types then IDE will verify
and warn you if your code mismatches the types. For example,
if you specified that original field type (OF) is List and
try to perform List operations on it in translator but
in reality your getter returns a String then IDE
will highlight the code and show a warning that code is malformed.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you correctly specify the types and make sure
IDE doesn't report any warnings.

IMPORTANT: Think twice before suppressing IDE with explicit cast.
IDE is your friend and reports a potential bug.

=== Handling multiple fields at once ===

If you are dealing with composite fields like a Managed Object
whose value is composed of multiple input fields then the best practice is:

* define a static nested canonical POGO with fields matching input fields
used for translation
* specify this POGO as type of input field
* return an instance of this POGO from getter and defaulter
* expect this POGO as input parameter of validator, translator and setter

image:Composite.svg[]

A setter will set just one output field in most cases. However,
there is no technical limitation to this and you are able
to propagate multiple output fields in setter if necessary.

=== Logging ===

Whenever a defaulter is used upon data error, a warning is printed to
log with detailed problem description. However, if
data error is thrown as exception (like when there is no defaulter
for a mandatory field) then nothing is logged by Mapper.
Instead, an exception will contain detailed information and
whoever has called a Mapper and caught the exception will have to
print it.

=== Field optionality ===

The difference between mandatory and optional fields:

|===
|What|Optional|Mandatory

|Input field absent
|Not a problem with input data but try to use defaulter,
just skip the field if none is configured
|Problem with input data: log a warning if have defaulter
or throw data error if not

|No defaulter and a problem with input data
|Log a warning, skip the field
|Throw data error exception

|Defaulter returns null
|Nothing special, going through usual chain
|Code error: why default value for a mandatory field is null?
It's not mandatory then?

|Translator returns null
|Nothing special, going through usual chain
|Code error: why resulting value for a mandatory field is null?
It's not mandatory then?

|===

=== Formal definition and testing ===

The full definition of what should happen for a
particular combination of inputs is defined
by MapperTestData.groovy. It contains
desired output and desired logging for each possible combination.
Desired outputs are:

* original value was propagated
* translated value was propagated
* default value was propagated
* nothing was propagated (field skipped)
* data error exception was thrown
* code error exception was thrown

Desired logging is either:

* none
* warning message

The table itself is generated by MapperTest.groovy. And can
be reviewed and if necessary adjusted by changing MapperTest.groovy.
MapperTest.groovy also contains a test for "manual" checking of
specific test cases. This can be used for regression testing and to
investigate Mapper behavior when you don't want to
go through full table.

=== Multi threading guarantees and requirements ===

Each state machine is static and doesn't have mutable state once constructed.
Particular configuration of a field, original and resulting object,
intermediate data like current value and current exception are
transferred around as method parameters. This means, it is safe
to use Mapper in multithreaded environment even for the same
Field objects. However, since Ctx object holding resulting
object is used by multiple fields, it is undesired to try to
translate multiple fields of the same object in parallel.
However, trying to translate different objects in parallel should be ok.
